                <li>For sessions shorter than two hours, the price will also be multiplied by 1.5. For example, if you schedule one-hour private sessions for five meetings, the price will be: (5 sessions x 1 hour x 200.000) x 1.5 = 1.500.000.</li>
                <li>Payments must be completed before the first session. Failure to make the payment on time may result in cancellation of the session.</li>
